# autonomous-vehicle
The premise of this project is to create an autonomous vehicle that can efficiently traverse hilly forest terrain avoiding collisions with objects whilst documenting squirrel population count.

The vehicle which uses a combination of various sensors and fuzzy controllers to produce a rules-based algorithm that controls vehicle direction and speed. Programmed using C and LabVIEW, simulated using TinkerCAD.
